Here's a step-by-step guide for downloading Trust Wallet, importing the Abay GERD contract, and getting the GERD wallet address on the Binance Smart Chain:

1. Download Trust Wallet:
   - For Android users: Visit the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wallet.crypto.trustapp) and search for "Trust Wallet." Download and install the app.
   - For iOS users: Visit the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trust-crypto-bitcoin-wallet/id1288339409) and search for "Trust Wallet." Download and install the app.

2. Set up Trust Wallet:
   - Open the Trust Wallet app on your device.
   - You'll be prompted to create a new wallet or import an existing one. If you're new to Trust Wallet, select "Create a New Wallet."
   - Carefully read and accept the terms and conditions.
   - The app will display a 12-word recovery phrase. Write down this phrase and store it in a secure location, as it will be used to recover your wallet if necessary. Never share this phrase with anyone.
   - Confirm your recovery phrase by selecting the words in the correct order, then tap "Continue."

3. Import the Abay GERD contract:
   - On the main screen, tap the "+" icon in the upper right corner to add a custom token.
   - Change the network to "BNB Smart Chain" if it isn't selected by default.
   - Enter the Abay GERD token contract address in the "Contract Address" field: 0x660941bb4AA9FcBED00375673D21088A9d0C5019
   - The app should automatically populate the "Name," "Symbol," and "Decimals" fields.
   - Tap "Save" or "Add" to complete the process.

4. Get your GERD wallet address:
   - From the main screen, you should now see the GERD token listed.
   - Tap on the Smart Chain BNB logo to access your Binance Smart Chain wallet.
   - Tap "Receive" or the QR code icon to display your Binance Smart Chain wallet address, which will also serve as your GERD wallet address.
   - You can now share this address to receive GERD tokens. Never share your private key or recovery phrase with anyone.

That's it! You can now manage your GERD tokens using Trust Wallet on the Binance Smart Chain. Keep in mind that you will need a small amount of BNB in your wallet to cover gas fees for token transfers and other transactions on the Binance Smart Chain network.
